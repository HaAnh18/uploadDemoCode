```

1. `controllers/`
This directory contains files responsible for handling the logic and functionality of the application.

2. `middlewares/`
Middleware functions are stored here. These functions can be applied to routes to perform tasks like authentication (auth.js), hashing (hash.js), and handling file uploads (upload.js).

3. `models/`
This directory holds the data models for interacting with the database.

4. `public/`
This directory usually contains static assets that can be served directly to the client, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

5. `routes/`
This directory probably contains JavaScript files defining the routes and corresponding handlers for the application.

6. `views/`
This directory typically contains files responsible for rendering HTML templates and views.

7. `.env`
This file contains ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES such as SECRET KEY, which is meant to be hidden and ignored by `.gitignore`.

8. `.gitignore`
Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked.

9. `app.js`
This file is commonly used to store environment variables for the application.

10. `package.json` & `package-lock.json`
Manage dependencies and package versions.

11. `README.md`
A text file containing useful reference information about this project.

## 2. Packages:

1. `dotenv`
A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This is useful for managing configuration in your Node.js applications.

2. `ejs`
Embedded JavaScript templating engine for rendering dynamic content on the server side.

3. `express`
A popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications. 

4. `mongodb`
The official MongoDB driver for Node.js. It allows your Node.js application to interact with a MongoDB database.

5. `mongoose`
A higher-level abstraction over the MongoDB driver, providing a more convenient and structured way to work with MongoDB databases in a Node.js environment.

6. `multer`
A middleware for handling file uploads in Express.js. It's often used with forms that include file input fields.

7. `nodemon`
A utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.
